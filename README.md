# Excel-Data-Pivoting-Macro
This VBA macro enables the transformation of data in an Excel worksheet by splitting values in a single row into multiple rows, effectively pivoting the data. Each value in the original row, separated by a semicolon, is distributed across multiple rows in a target worksheet while maintaining the corresponding ID for each value.
